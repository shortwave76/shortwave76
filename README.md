- 👋 Hi, I’m @shortwave76
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and sound design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games
- 📫 How to reach me - through here, I guess?

I'm new to this whole thing, but I have a few game ideas that I want to bring to life. I've started learning Godot, and I have a veeeeery basic prototype of my first game--a Plinko/Peggle-style game that combines some aspects of TD games as well...

Anyway, I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can...
